latestxspf is a simple script which generates an XSPF playlist containing
the latest additions to your local music collection.

It was just a quick idea and it may not be needed anymore when Tomahawk someday 
implements something comparable (viewing the latest additions).

latestxspf depends on TagPy <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tagpy>.
